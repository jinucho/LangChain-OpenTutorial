    "**Chroma** is an open-source vector database optimized for semantic search and RAG applications. It offers **fast similarity search**, **metadata filtering**, and supports both **in-memory** and **persistent storage**. With built-in or **custom embedding functions** and a **simple Python API**, it's easy to integrate into ML pipelines.\n",

    "\n",
    "![chroma](./assets/02-chroma-with-langchain-chroma-logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "```Chroma``` is an open-source embedding database built for enabling semantic search in AI applications.  \n",
    "It is commonly used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) pipelines to manage and search document embeddings efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional databases or pure vector stores, ```Chroma``` combines vector similarity with structured metadata filtering.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows developers to build hybrid search systems that consider both the meaning of the text and metadata constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy-to-use API** : Simplifies vector management and querying through a clean Python interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistent storage** : Supports both in-memory and on-disk storage for scalable deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metadata filtering** : Enables precise search using custom fields stored alongside vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Built-in similarity search** : Provides fast approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) retrieval using cosine distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local-first and open-source** : No cloud lock-in; can run entirely on local or edge environments."
